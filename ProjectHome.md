Java implementation of an unsupervised ontology (taxonomy) extraction technique for web data based on:
  * the bag-of-words model,
  * hierarchical clustering,
  * a custom cosine distance/similarity metric, and
  * Fibonacci weighting.

This work was supported by the [CORDER](http://projects.kmi.open.ac.uk/corder/) project of the Open University (Milton Keynes, UK). We extracted an ontology (taxonomy) of computer science areas from the website of the University of Manchester computer science department. The algorithm was validated using the ACM classification of computer science subject areas.
